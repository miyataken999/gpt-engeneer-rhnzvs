================================ System Message ================================

You will get instructions for code to write.
You will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
```
CODE
```

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
```
print("Hello World")
```

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.


You will start with the "entrypoint" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Include module dependency or package manager dependency definition file.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the architecture is present in the files.

When you are done, write finish with "this concludes a fully working implementation".

Useful to know:
Almost always put different classes in different files.
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
For Python, you always create an appropriate requirements.txt file.
For NodeJS, you always create an appropriate package.json file.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

Request: ご負担金とは何ですか？ご負担金とは何ですか？

================================== Ai Message ==================================

I see you're asking about "ご負担金" which is a Japanese term that roughly translates to "burden money" or "onus money". It's a concept commonly used in Japan, especially in the context of business and finance.

To create a Python application that demonstrates the concept of ご負担金, I'll design a simple system that calculates the burden money for a group of people. Let's get started!

Here's the file structure for our project:
```
onus_money_calculator/
onus_money_calculator/
__init__.py
models/
__init__.py
person.py
calculator.py
services/
__init__.py
onus_calculator.py
main.py
requirements.txt
```
Let's start with the `person.py` file:
```
onus_money_calculator/models/person.py
```
```
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Person:
    """Represents a person with a name and a share of the burden."""
    name: str
    share: float

    def __post_init__(self):
        if self.share <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Share must be a positive value")
```
Next, let's create the `calculator.py` file:
```
onus_money_calculator/models/calculator.py
```
```
from .person import Person

class OnusCalculator:
    """Calculates the burden money for a group of people."""
    def __init__(self, people: list[Person]):
        self.people = people

    def calculate_onus(self, total_amount: float) -> dict[Person, float]:
        """Calculates the burden money for each person."""
        total_share = sum(person.share for person in self.people)
        onus_amounts = {}
        for person in self.people:
            onus_amount = (person.share / total_share) * total_amount
            onus_amounts[person] = onus_amount
        return onus_amounts
```
Now, let's create the `onus_calculator.py` file:
```
onus_money_calculator/services/onus_calculator.py
```
```
from .models.calculator import OnusCalculator

class OnusCalculatorService:
    """Provides a service to calculate the burden money."""
    def calculate_onus(self, people: list[dict], total_amount: float) -> dict:
        """Calculates the burden money for a list of people."""
        people_objects = [Person(**person) for person in people]
        calculator = OnusCalculator(people_objects)
        onus_amounts = calculator.calculate_onus(total_amount)
        return {person.name: onus_amount for person, onus_amount in onus_amounts.items()}
```
Next, let's create the `main.py` file:
```
onus_money_calculator/main.py
```
```
from .services.onus_calculator import OnusCalculatorService

def main():
    """Main entry point of the application."""
    onus_calculator_service = OnusCalculatorService()
    people = [{"name": "Alice", "share": 0.4}, {"name": "Bob", "share": 0.3}, {"name": "Charlie", "share": 0.3}]
    total_amount = 1000.0
    onus_amounts = onus_calculator_service.calculate_onus(people, total_amount)
    for person, onus_amount in onus_amounts.items():
        print(f"{person}: {onus_amount:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
Finally, let's create the `requirements.txt` file:
```
onus_money_calculator/requirements.txt
```
```
dataclasses
```
This concludes a fully working implementation of the ご負担金 calculator in Python!
