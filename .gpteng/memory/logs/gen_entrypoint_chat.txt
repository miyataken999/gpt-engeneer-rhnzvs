================================ System Message ================================

You will get information about a codebase that is currently on disk in the current folder.
The user will ask you to write a script that runs the code in a specific way.
You will answer with code blocks that include all the necessary terminal commands.
Do not install globally. Do not use sudo.
Do not explain the code, just give the commands.
Do not use placeholders, use example values (like . for a folder argument) if necessary.


================================ Human Message =================================


        Make a unix script that
        a) installs dependencies
        b) runs all necessary parts of the codebase (in parallel if necessary)
        
Information about the codebase:

```
File: project
1 onus_money_calculator/
2 onus_money_calculator/
3 __init__.py
4 models/
5 __init__.py
6 person.py
7 calculator.py
8 services/
9 __init__.py
10 onus_calculator.py
11 main.py
12 requirements.txt

File: file
1 onus_money_calculator/requirements.txt

File: value)
1 Next, let's create the `calculator.py` file:

File: onus_money_calculator/models/calculator.py
1 ```
2 from .person import Person
3 
4 class OnusCalculator:
5     """Calculates the burden money for a group of people."""
6     def __init__(self, people: list[Person]):
7         self.people = people
8 
9     def calculate_onus(self, total_amount: float) -> dict[Person, float]:
10         """Calculates the burden money for each person."""
11         total_share = sum(person.share for person in self.people)
12         onus_amounts = {}
13         for person in self.people:
14             onus_amount = (person.share / total_share) * total_amount
15             onus_amounts[person] = onus_amount
16         return onus_amounts

File: onus_amounts.items()}
1 Next, let's create the `main.py` file:

File: onus_money_calculator/main.py
1 ```
2 from .services.onus_calculator import OnusCalculatorService
3 
4 def main():
5     """Main entry point of the application."""
6     onus_calculator_service = OnusCalculatorService()
7     people = [{"name": "Alice", "share": 0.4}, {"name": "Bob", "share": 0.3}, {"name": "Charlie", "share": 0.3}]
8     total_amount = 1000.0
9     onus_amounts = onus_calculator_service.calculate_onus(people, total_amount)
10     for person, onus_amount in onus_amounts.items():
11         print(f"{person}: {onus_amount:.2f}")
12 
13 if __name__ == "__main__":
14     main()

```

================================== Ai Message ==================================

Here is the Unix script that installs dependencies and runs the codebase:
```
#!/bin/bash

# Install dependencies
pip install -r onus_money_calculator/requirements.txt

# Run the main script
python onus_money_calculator/main.py
```
